    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, I'm Rein! I'm a sophomore studying Computer Science at PUP Manila. As I explore different areas within the IT industry, I'm working on finding my niche. Currently, I'm interested in web development, UI/UX design, and data science, and I aspire to become skilled in these fields in the near future. I'm excited to learn and grow alongside all of you!</p>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy watching movies and shows, drawing (both traditional and sometimes digital), singing, running, and listening to music.</p>

    <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
    <p>Last September, I attended a Bruno Major concert, and I'm super excited to see NIKI live this coming March!
